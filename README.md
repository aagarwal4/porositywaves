# Numerical Modeling of 3D Porosity Waves

This is the repository for the project involving numerical modeling of 3D porosity waves. Porosity waves are an active area of research, and have potential impact for characterizing hydrocarbon migration, CO<sub>2</sub>  as well as for slow earthquakes. These are nonlinear solitary waves, and have been modeled here in a viscoelastic medium. 

The computation for obtaining porosity and pressure after an initial Gaussian perturbation was performed using an explicit finite difference scheme with forward-Euler in space [here](porosity_3d.py). The simulation can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5JHF3TQfmV7NHRqR291Q29TVUk/view).
